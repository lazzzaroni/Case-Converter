# Case-Converter
Project from "Frontend Developer" path by Hyperskill

## What I've learned
- grabbing elements from DOM (`getElementById()`);
- adding event listeners and simple logic (`addEventListener()`);
- splitting lements, doing manipulations with them and joining them back (`split()`, `slice()`, `join()`).

I decided to add some styles, because why not?)
