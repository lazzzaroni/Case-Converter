# Case-Converter
Project from "Frontend Developer" path by Hyperskill

## What I've learned
- grabbing elements from DOM (.getElementById());
- adding event listeners and simple logic (.addEventListener());
- splitting lements, doing manipulations with them and joining them back (.split(), .slice(), .join()).

I decided to add some styles, because why not?)
